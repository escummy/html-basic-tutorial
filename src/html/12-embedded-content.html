<!-- What is embedded content

  - Embedded content is the content that we bring from outside

  - These files are the ones that will bring more weight on our website:
  (Images, videos, audios and iframes, although iframes are not considered embedded content, we will put them inside this section since we bring them from outside)

-->
<!-- We can classify web image formats into two types:

  1.Vectorial -> SVG (recommended whenever possible)

  2. Bitmap -> JPG, PNG (8 bits and 24 bits, if we need transparencies), GIF (if an animated image is needed) and WEBP (the format that weighs less, is developed by google)

  <!-- But for device pixel rartio: There are 2 ways to support all browser

    *First-------- (Less common due to its age)

    We will use the srcset="/" (set source) attribute, to indicate to the browser, through a set of images, which one we want to display according to the device pixel ratio, that is, through what condition we want it to load one or the other by default (generally in the mobiles the images are smaller between 320px and 360px) so we will put in more than 1x the dpx, in mobiles it is usually 2x or 3x device pixel ratio

    <img srcset="/assets/images/550x829.webp, /assets/images/550x829.jpg, /assets/images/550x829-mobile.webp 2x, /assets/images/550x829-mobile.jpg 2x" alt=" Image description">

    *Second-------- (Recommended, although see if CSS breakpoints are better)

    The most used method is the <picture></picture> tag, which has another <source srcset="/"> tag inside.

    This will only show an image if we place a backup with <img src="/" alt"Image description">, otherwise it won't do anything, since you need to have a backup copy just in case to show at least one in .jpg format

    We can also use the corresponding DPR for mobile (1x, 2x, 3x...)
    Another way to do it would also be with the attribute

    media="(max-width:Width in pixels) or (min-width:Width in pixels)"

    <picture>
      <source srcset="/assets/images/550x829-mobile.webp 2x, /assets/images/550x829-mobile.jpg 2x">
      <img src="/assets/images/550x829.webp, /assets/images/550x529.jpg" alt="Image description">
    </picture>

    <picture>
      <source srcset="/assets/images/550x829-mobile.webp, /assets/images/550x829-mobile.jpg" media="(max-width:1200px)">
      <img src="/assets/images/550x829.webp, /assets/images/550x529.jpg" alt="Image description">
    </picture>

  -->

  <!-- -AUDIOS- and -VIDEOS-

    We will put the <audio src="" tag or the <video src="" tag followed by the attributes that we want, it is possible that it works locally for us but when we are in a real domain there are some cases such as:

    controls -> Boolean attribute, which gives us a dashboard

    autoplay -> So that when reloading the page or scrolling, it plays automatically, browsers block autoplay if it is not silenced
    
    muted -> Mutes the video until the person activates it so as not to block autoplay like Instagram does, and it plays but doesn't bother the user

    loop -> It allows us once the video is over to start again (in loop)

    poster -> To put an initial image (thumbnail), we will put the path inside the attribute, it can only be done in videos and it would not be well appreciated with autoplay

    <audio src="/assets/audio/audio.mp3" controls autoplay muted></audio>

    <video src="/assets/video/video.mp4" controls autoplay muted poster="/"
    </video>

  -->

  <!-- IFRAMES: It is basically inserting a website within ours, to be able to have the characteristics of the video frame or characteristics of the site from which we bring the resource (Youtube, facebook, instagram, spotify, components, forms, slide photos. ..), this slows down the loading of the page a lot, in addition to inserting a <!DOCTYPE html> and other resources that slow down the web, but to be able to do it this would be the way:

    When we go to the resource and click on share, it gives you the classic options plus the option for developers that appears with the symbol </> (iframe)

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vz4z0RLcAyk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *The only MANDATORY attributes are the width, height and src from where we will bring the iframe, the rest we can eliminate if necessary.

  -->

  <!-- The <figure></figure> tag is used in addition to images, to fill in related content but it is optional, if we removed it, the rest of the content would still make sense, an example would be an article about cats with its paragraphs and we put a link (link) of a cat whatever, a graph, a table with data or anything, and we would continue with what we were talking about without losing relevance, (THIS IS THE CORRECT WAY).

    To mention quotes or code snippets, it must be done with <figure>

    Apart we can put a brief description of this with the tag <figcaption></figcaption>

  <!-- -ACCESSIBILITY ATTRIBUTES-

    This gives for an entire video according to Dorian, since it is very important today and quite extensive, some of the most important are not only for blind people but for those people who want to navigate by pressing tab and not with the use of the mouse, so that they can navigate faster and jump from one paragraph to another and in which the order is VERY IMPORTANT:

  -->

  <p tabindex="1">Paragraph 1</p>
  <p tabindex="2">Paragraph 2</p>
  <p tabindex="3">Paragraph 3</p>


  <!-- Chromevox classic extension for example is a reader screen for people who cannot read, and in which the browser will read the two called attributes (aria and rol), making a description of the page including photos and links

  (example) -->

  <a href="#" aria-label="Come back to the top">Go to top</a>

  <!-- OPEN GRAPH PROTOCOL: They are the default thumbnails that facebook has every time we share a link, it is very important to put the content that is going to be seen (Title, description, image, link)

  <!-- TWITTER CARD: It is the same as the facebook protocol, except that to change something we must go to SAMPLE CODE where we will only have to modify the content in the text that it gives us by default and check if we have done it the way correct in the Twitter Card Validation tab, where we will enter the URL and it will generate a preview of the card CARD, Summary card, player card, App card -->
