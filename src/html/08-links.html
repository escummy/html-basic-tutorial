<!-- The links:
  
  Also known as Links, its objective is to connect a web page with another web page, it can be used both to move within the same web, and for another web page.

It has a mandatory attribute called href, where we specify the path of the resource or the site that we want to obtain.

They also have a "target" attribute, which configures how we want to view the resource or site we request

Moving within the same page is through an anchor element: -->

<body>
  <a href="path-source-or-site">Path of the source or site</a><br>

  <!-- Examples-->
  <a href="00-instructions.html">Go to the 'Instructions'</a><br>
  <a href="09-section-vs-article.html">Move between files of the project</a><br>
  <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">I am a link to 'The Odin Project' website</a><br>


  <!-- Absolute paths:

They have an http or https protocol and are unique in the network, they are usually used for external routes generally, except for very specific cases -->

  <!-- Relative paths:

They can be relative to the point where we are or relative to the root of the project (we will only use the bar / to load suggestions in case the destination page is not found

It is recommended to use this route whenever possible in our projects)

- They have no protocol

If the resource is at the same level (folder), we will only put the name of the file, but if what we want is to leave a current folder (we will use ../ ) for each level we want to leave -->


  <!-- Link attributes:

target: Defines where the requested resource will be opened, as a general rule whenever you use absolute paths it would be 

"_blank" (if we want to open it in a new tab)

"_self" (it is the default value and it is like not doing nothing) with which it will open it in the same tab, we will hardly ever use the latter.

download: It is a boolean attribute and is used to download the requested content

- IMPORTANT - The resource must be on your own server.

Navigation through Anchors (anchor):

To be able to scroll within our page or between pages, we need to put the hash "#" inside the element <a href="#"></a> and the id="" in the part where we want it to go, without id= it won't work.

In the case of doing it to a different page, we select the route using the slash and the destination followed by the entry with a "#" and the POST that we want, leaving something like this (/1stTest/home.html#Post1).

-->

  <!-- To go at specific section in the navbar by #id -->
  <nav>
    <p><a href="#Post1">Post1</a></p>
    <p><a href="#Post2">Post2</a></p>
    <p><a href="#Post3">Post3</a></p>
    <p><a href="#Post4">Post4</a></p>
    <p><a href="/1st-proof/the-avengers.html#Post5">post5</a></p>
  </nav>

  <!-- Same process to navigate between posts by #id in the body -->
  <section>
    <article>
      <h1 id="Post1">Post 1</h1>
      <h1 id="Post2">Post 2</h1>
      <h1 id="Post3">Post 3</h1>
      <h1 id="Post4">Post 4</h1>
      <h1 id="Post5">Post 5</h1>
    </article>
  </section>

  <!-- DEAD LINKS or EMPTY while testing JavaScript for example would be ("#")

  <a href="#"> ... </a>
  <a href="#" target="_blank">cat photos</a>

-->

  <!-- Converts an IMAGE to a LINK ("#")

  <a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
