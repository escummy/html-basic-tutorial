<!-- Tables in HTML:
  
  Are used to tabulate content in a semantically correct way, and it is only used in some specific cases, although it will later be styled with CSS.

The basic structure of a table is composed of:

table -> Tag that encloses a table
tr -> Table row, is the tag that builds a fixed
td -> Table data, is the label that builds a cell


Trick: The number of cells inside a <tr></tr> will set the number of columns in the table

The TITLES of the tables are established with the <caption></caption> tag, it is a special tag, since not all tables need a title, but according to your specification it will be placed right after the <table></table tag >.

The HEADERS of the tables are established with the <thead></thead> tag, in which a normal <tr></tr> tag will go inside, but in the case of cells, we establish them with the <th> tag in place of <td>

  The content of the table must go inside the <tbody></tbody> tag to represent the body of the table, so optionally, we can also put a <tfoot></tfoot> to the table to establish a footer inside, this is something that some tables interpret as sum of amounts or total.

To make the cells occupy more than one row or more than one column, we will use 2 ATTRIBUTES:

  rowspan: For a cell to occupy more than one row (default value is 1)
  colspan: so that a cell occupies more than one column (default value is 1), a common error in this attribute is not deleting the determined number of rows that we want to occupy, thus the table will not be unbalanced.

  *If we go to "BreaK" and put a colspan we will see that it is not visible, but it is occupying the entire line of 5 cells, for that we will apply a small CSS demo.

  *When what we want is to select a column, the <colgroup></colgroup> tag is used, which allows us to select a specific column. Within this tag, the <col> tag would be placed as many columns as we have, each <col> tag will give a column following the same order as the table.

  While if what we need is for the <col> tag to group more than one column, the Span="" attribute will be placed on it (which would be exactly the same as a rowspan or colspan)
