<!-- Attributes:
  
  They are additional values that are given to an element to configure and/or adjust this behavior.

There are 2 types in general terms:

Common: Syntax is (attribute = "value")
Booleans: Syntax is simply (attribute (true/false))

Some global attributes that are available for most tags:

class -> This attribute is used for styling is CSS, but it's not recommended at all to give styles here in the HTML

id -> It's a unique identifier that is used to select an element from JavaScript and also to navigate through anchors

title -> It's an attribute that helps accessibility, showing a description of the element to which it belongs (when hovering the message appears in a Tooltip)

data -> It's a very useful attribute that allows us to store a value in the html tag, and also when we use JavaScript
