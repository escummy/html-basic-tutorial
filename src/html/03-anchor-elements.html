            The Avengers were born in 1963 from the minds of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, as a response to the famous DC comic Justice League that, at that time, monopolized all the number ones in the sales rankings. Although it should be noted that, unlike The Justice League, where its members were the best of DC (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman...), the Avengers that Stan and Jack chose for their collection were not <em>Superstars</em> of the publisher.

            Not surprisingly, it was the most disparate group to date, with Iron Man (who owed his powers to technology), Thor (an <em>Asgarian</em> deity), Hulk (a mass of power and uncontrollable fury), The Ant-Man (scientist transformed into a hero) and The Wasp (Ant-Man's partner who derives his powers from his science). At that time, The Avengers was a very risky bet with very rare heroes for the time and branded as loners, forced by circumstances to work as a team.

              When the <em>Asgardian god</em> Loki seeks revenge against his brother Thor, his machinations inadvertently lead teenager Rick Jones to collect Ant-Man, Wasp and <i>Iron Man</i> to aid Thor and the Hulk, whom Loki used as a pawn. After the group defeated Loki, Ant-Man stated that the five of them worked well together and suggested that they team up, Wasp called the group, <strong>Avengers</strong>.

            The team found new characters like <em>Arkon</em> in issue (April 1970), and Red Wolf in issue #80 (September 1970). The team's adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the <strong>Kree-Skrull War</strong>, an epic battle between the Kree, <i>'Kree alien races Skrull'</i> and the <i>'Kree guest star'</i>, <strong>Captain Marvel</strong>. The Avengers briefly disbanded when the Skrulls pose as Captain America, Thor and <i>Iron Man</i> used their authority as founders of the team and disbanded it. The real founding Avengers, minus the Wasp, reformed the team in response to Jarvis's complaints.

            The first big breakthrough was the collapse of <strong>Henry Pym</strong> with his frequent changes of clothing and name being symptomatic of an identity problem and inferiority complex. After abusing his wife, failing to win back the Avengers' trust with a ruse, and being tricked by the villainous Egghead, Pym was imprisoned. Pym then outsmarted Egghead and defeated the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil on his account, proving his innocence. Pym reconciled with Wasp, but they decided to stay apart. Pym retired from <i>super heroes</i>, but returned years later.

            The United States government revoked the Avengers <i>New York State</i> charter in a treaty with the <i>Soviet Union</i>. The Avengers were then given a charter by the United Nations and the Avengers split into two teams with a reserve alternate team backing up the main teams.

            The Avengers received international authority from the United Nations. Members who joined during that period included Jack of Hearts and the second <i>Ant-Man</i>. A new Captain Britain was added to the team. The story of <strong>"Avengers Disassembled"</strong> followed. Entitled Chaos, the story featured the deaths of some members and the team's loss of credibility. The culprit is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch, who had been driven insane after agonizing over the memory of her lost children and subsequently lost control of her reality-altering powers. With the team in disarray and <i>Avengers Mansion</i> in ruins, the surviving members agreed to disband.

      Well, in the first issue of we are told how <strong>Loki</strong>, brother of <strong>Thor</strong> with insatiable ambition, sets a trap for the Hulk so that he is considered guilty of a train accident (although in reality he manages to save all the travelers). After this, Loki sends a message for his brother to intercept and thus ambush him. Luckily for Thor, the message also reaches the ears of Ant-Man and Iron Man. Together they discover that everything has been a trap and end Loki's plans. Thus the Avengers were born.

Being in comic number four the first where Captain America already appears. In this way, the classic trident of The Avengers is completed: Iron Man, Thor and Captain America.

      One of the main attractions of the formation, in the comics of course, is the incessant tide of superheroes that pass through The Avengers. Not in vain, to date, there are more than <strong>75 superheroes</strong> that have been part of the group and that we can divide into three categories: full members (those who go to all the missions), reserves (who go when a superhero cannot) and fees (who were never officially part of The Avengers but are given this position in recognition of some help provided).
