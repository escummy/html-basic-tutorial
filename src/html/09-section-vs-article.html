<!-- Correct uses of the SECTION, ARTICLE and ASIDE tag -->

<!-- Section: s a generic container that groups content that is related, when we create blocks whose content is within a total block, the semantically correct thing is to use a section -->

<!-- Article: is a container that represents independent content, that is, we can read that fragment in any other site and it would still make sense by itself -->

<!-- Aside: Used to represent related content that is not part of the main content -->

<!-- NESTING: A "Section" can contain articles, for example, if we have several sections that talk about the same topic, such as talking about HTML tags, these should go inside a section, since the content is related each other, while "Article" would be independent content, since we could read one without having read the rest and it would still make sense on its own (as it is defined as an independent page component, this indicates that it could have a < header></header> and a <footer></footer>) -->

<!-- There is also the case in which ARTICLE contains several sections, the independent article could be talking about browsers and this could contain sections such as "Most used browsers in 2021" -->

<!-- EXAMPLE (SECTION): Different news that are not related -->

Simple example of (ASIDE):

<!-- It is used to represent directly related content but that is not part of the main content, that is, it talks about the same thing but is not part of the main content, be it a menu, related courses, a link to youtube, etcetera.
  
Semantically correct it would be placed outside the <main></main>, but both the W3C and the MDN consider it valid to put it both inside and outside the main content -->


<!-- Outside is more correct because of the tag name -->

<body>
  <header>Advanced level programming courses</header>
  <aside>Basic level courses from scratch</aside>
  <main>
    
  </main>
</body>


<!-- Inside is also valid although it is not recommended -->

<body>
  <header>Advanced level programming courses</header>
  <main>
    <aside>Basic level courses from scratch</aside>
  </main>
</body>
