<!-- Inline tags:

  span -> It's a line container, equivalent to div, it is usually used to enclose words or small texts and thus style it through CSS, or to locate them from JavaScript (semantically it does not mean anything)

  q -> It's the equivalent of blockquote, it means quote and that is why the block quote is called <blockquote>, and it's used to put important quotes but in one line, it can also have the attribute cite="https://. ......."

  code -> It serves to enclose precisely the code that we want to represent visually, it is usually attached to the <pre> tag
