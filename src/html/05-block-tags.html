<!-- Block tags -->

<!--
  
  address -> It's used to give contact information to the closest article or also for the entire body

Example: A specific news occurred in a place that is relevant, while if we place it in the footer, this would correspond to the contact address of the owner of the website instead.

blockquote -> It's used to mark citations to other authors or documents to the browser (you can put the attribute cite="") to create a link to the original document/source

pre -> It's used to be able to put a preformatted code, which needs to be represented the same as it was written

div -> It's used to divide the document, semantically it does not mean anything, so it is a generic container that is used to give styles through CSS or to use something called "event delegation" in javaScript

hr -> Horizontal rule, is used to tell the browser that we are going to change the theme

                          -Fine, thanks
                                              I'm glad! Take care

<!-- Div is a content separator, 95% of the time just for CSS unless we want to separate users, contact information and other things without mixing them within the same content separator -->

  <div>
    <h2>user1</h2>
    <p>email</p>
    <p>description</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>user2</h2>
    <p>email</p>
