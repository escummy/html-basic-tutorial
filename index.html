<!-- Follow instructions in order to continue the tutorial correctly.

    To start the practice we need to use a code editor.

    If you don't know which editor use, check this post:
    https://github.com/escummy/vscode-settings-json

    -Comment code-

    Comments in the code are used in development to give a specification to ourselves but also to other developers.
    
    Every comment is ignored by the browser completely and if you check, all this code is being commented for you to read -->

<!-- This is a comment -->

<!-- This is a multiline comment....
  .... Hello again -->

<!-- LET'S START writing code:

    Open your favorite code editor and simply type the symbol '!' and press enter, modern code editors set us the basic standard type of an HTML5 document as below -->


<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Language of the HTML document (ENGLISH) -->
<html lang="en">

<!-- HEAD specify to the browser some metadata and meta tags among others -->

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>I am the title of the TAB in the browser</title>
</head>

<!-- BODY is where we can create titles, subtitles, paragraphs and much more-->
<!-- In my case, I'm going to create the index of the tutorial -->

  <h1>HTML tutorial practice</h1>
  <h2>What exactly is HTML?</h2><br>
  <h3>HyperText Markup Language</h3>

  <p>It is the most basic component of the Web. Define the meaning and structure of web content by using "markup" to tag text, images, and other content for display in a web browser.</p>

  <p>All tags in HTM have an opening symbol and a closing symbol except for some specific cases that you will see in the tutorial.</p>

  <p> Before starting, we must clarify that the 'index.html' document refers to the main document of a website, it will make a request to a local server in which it will display the labels that we will see on the screen.</p><br>

  <h4>** IMPORTANT **</h4>
  <p>HTML document is not to make it look good, it is simply used to give the browser a series of information regarding the structure of our website, to make it more beautiful or aesthetic instead, we will always use 'Cascade Style Sheet', and although in some cases it may be necessary to do it in the HTML document, it's not recommended at all to give styles here, we have already CSS language to do that.</p>

  <!-- <br> is a tag that not need close tag like this </br> and it's used to jump 1 line and although they are useful, we will see other best uses and good practices during the course -->
